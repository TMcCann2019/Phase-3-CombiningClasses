# Phase 3 Lecture 4: Combining Multiple Classes and Objects

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to perform basic inheritance as well as combine two classes together in a one-to-many relationship structure.

## Lesson Plan

0. Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.
1. Define two classes, Orange and Void, that inherit from the Cat class. Override some methods and utilize some others.
    - What is **inheritance**? What kind of hierarchy does it imply?
    - What is **super**?
2. Define two classes, Book and Owner, such that they reflect a one-to-many relationship.
    - How can an Owner object contain many Book objects? How can we show the reflexive as well?
    - How does `isinstance` function?
    - Why do we need a separate file to test these?

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lecture will introduce how to use the SSOT to combine multiple classes in a many-to-many relationship structure.
